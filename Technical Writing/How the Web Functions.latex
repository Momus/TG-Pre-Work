\begin{abstract}
  This essay gives a brief introduction to what goes on ``behind the
  scenes'' when a user requests a web page in a browser.
  Specifically, it answes the following questions:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{itm:landing} When we hit \texttt{https://www.techtonicgroup.com/} what happens? Donâ€™t
    focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices,
    etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.
  \item \label{itm: render} From start to finish, how does that data reach you to be rendered
    in the browser?
  \item What code is rendered in the browser
  \item What is the server-side code's main function?
  \item How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS,
    Images, etc.) are created?
  \item How many instances of the server side code are avialable at any given time?
  \item What is runtime?
  \item How many instances of the databases connected to the server
    applicatoin are created?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{abstract}

This is my docuent, it should have \ref{itm:landing} references to the questions in the abstract.
