*** The request
    With all the magic surrounding the World Wide Web, it's easy to
    lose sight of what it is and was designed to be: a document
    retrieval system.  When users wants to access $SITE, they need acess
    to a document.  Bedind the scenes, the web browser, the Internet,
    and the server are meant to work seamlessly to retrieve and
    compose that document for viewing without the user having to worry
    about how any of that is done.

    Just as users only need to know to that to get a document they
    have to ask a web browsers, web browsers are part of a network
    stack that dosen't require them to know how to retrieve a docuent
    with nothing more than a URL.  The browser sits on the top layer
    of the network stack, the Application Layer, and it only to ask
    the layer below, the Tranport Layer to fullfil its request.

    - First, ask to open a connection: (TCP: URL protocol==port)
    - then fetch document GET request.
